        Welcome to the Educational Technology library. This library is primarily assembled as an archive of resources for the Georgia Tech OMSCS CS6460 class by the same name. Below you&#39;ll find several pages with publications, media articles, original interviews, and other resources on a number of different topics in Educational Technology.

        An alternative version of this library, structured as a Udacity course, is available here. The content of the two versions of the library is equivalent: videos in the alternative library are included as links below, and wiki pages below are embedded in the alternative library.

        This library is constantly growing. To catch up on the latest additions across the entire library since your last visit, please see the changelog. Generally speaking, this web site is constructed by course instructor David Joyner, and any text presented in first-person can be assumed to come from him — or should I say, from me.
